# Loganathan Yathavan — Portfolio

A cinematic, animation-driven personal portfolio built with **React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and GSAP**. Built to showcase full-stack and backend engineering work with motion design that reflects the actual craft — not generic template animation.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Pinned, scroll-scrubbed hero** — three "system state" scenes (`[BOOT]` → `[BUILD]` → `[TEST]`) cross-fade as the page scrolls, tied to the tagline *"I ship things end to end, then go find out why they broke."*
- **Timed autoplay showcase carousel** — a large photographic stage cycles through six featured projects every 5 seconds, with a progress bar, staggered text reveals, and a clickable thumbnail stack. Pauses on hover.
- **Full project grid** — all 13 repositories, each with a matching photo, category tag, and tech stack, revealed with a staggered scroll animation.
- **Light, high-contrast design system** — off-white canvas, white card surfaces, dark navy text, amber/teal accents. Space Grotesk + IBM Plex Mono + Inter.
- **Accessible by default** — respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (skips pinned scroll-scrub and autoplay), and simplifies to crossfades with a swipeable card list on mobile.
- **Single source of truth for content** — every piece of text, every project, every link lives in one typed data file.

## 🛠 Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Build tool | Vite |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 (`@theme` design tokens) |
| Animation | GSAP + `@gsap/react` (`useGSAP`, `ScrollTrigger`) |
| Fonts | Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Mono, Inter (Google Fonts) |

No UI component library, no CSS-in-JS — plain Tailwind utility classes and a small set of custom CSS variables for theming.

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs a fully static site to `dist/`. `vite.config.ts` is set to `base: './'`, so the build works from any subpath — including a GitHub Pages project site like `username.github.io/repo-name/`.

### Preview the production build locally

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## 📦 Deploying

### Render (recommended)

This site is a static build, so deploy it on Render as a **Static Site**, not a Web Service:

1. Push this project to a GitHub (or GitLab) repo
2. In the Render dashboard: **New → Static Site**
3. Connect the repo, then set:
   | Setting | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Build Command | `npm run build` |
   | Publish Directory | `dist` |
4. Click **Create Static Site** — Render installs dependencies, runs the build, and deploys `dist/` automatically
5. You get a free `your-app-name.onrender.com` URL, with an option to attach a custom domain under the site's **Settings → Custom Domains**

**Redeploys:** Render auto-deploys on every push to the connected branch by default — just `git push` and the live site updates. No need to run `npm run build` locally or upload anything manually.

**SPA routing note:** this project only uses in-page anchor links (`#work`, `#about`, etc.), so no rewrite rule is needed. If you later add client-side routes (React Router), add a rewrite rule in Render's **Redirects/Rewrites** settings: source `/*`, destination `/index.html`, action `Rewrite`.

### Other static hosts

Any static host works the same way — build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`:

**GitHub Pages**
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Push the contents of `dist/` to your Pages branch (or use a GitHub Action to build + deploy automatically)
3. Enable Pages in your repo settings, pointing at that branch

**Netlify / Vercel**
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Drag the `dist/` folder into [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop), or connect the repo and set build command `npm run build` with publish directory `dist`

## ✏️ Editing content

Every piece of text on the site — bio, stats, projects, skills, timeline, references, contact details — lives in a single typed file:

```
src/data/portfolio.ts
```

Update that file and the whole site stays in sync automatically. No need to touch component code for a content change.

### Swapping project photos

Each entry in the `projects` array has an `image:` field pointing at a stock photo chosen to match that project's subject matter. To use real screenshots of your own apps instead:

1. Drop your screenshot files into `public/`
2. Replace the corresponding `image:` URL with the local path, e.g. `"/screenshots/moodaware.png"`

### Adding a new project

Add a new object to the `projects` array in `src/data/portfolio.ts` (and optionally to `featuredProjectIds` if it should appear in the rotating showcase). The grid and carousel both render from that array — no other changes needed.

## 🎨 Design system

Defined as CSS variables in `src/index.css` under `@theme`, so every color is a single source of truth:

| Token | Use |
|---|---|
| `--color-canvas` | Page background (off-white) |
| `--color-paper` | Card / raised surface background (white) |
| `--color-ink` | Primary text (dark navy) |
| `--color-slate` / `--color-slate-dim` | Secondary / tertiary text |
| `--color-amber` / `--color-amber-text` | Accent — vivid fill vs. text-safe variant |
| `--color-signal` / `--color-signal-text` | Secondary accent (teal) — same fill/text split |
| `--color-scrim` | Fixed dark overlay used only on photo panels, independent of page theme |

---

## ♿ Accessibility & performance notes

- Honors `prefers-reduced-motion`: skips the pinned scroll-scrub hero and carousel autoplay for users who have that OS setting enabled.
- Mobile viewports get a simplified crossfade hero (no scroll pinning, which tends to fight with touch scroll momentum) and a swipeable card list instead of hover-dependent thumbnails.
- All interactive elements are keyboard-focusable with visible focus states.
